-- SUPPORT — making it a conversation instead of a drop box.
--
-- Until now a support message went one way: into Telegram, where it was read
-- and answered by email. Email is slow, lands in spam, and ends the thread —
-- the person asking has usually gone by the time it arrives.
--
-- This table is the join between the two sides. Every message the bubble sends
-- is posted to Telegram and recorded here with the id of the Telegram message
-- it became. When the owner swipe-replies to that message, Telegram hands us
-- back the id it was a reply to, which is how we know which visitor the answer
-- belongs to. Nothing else identifies them: there is no account to sign into.
--
-- `visitor_id` is the random string minted in the visitor's own browser. It is
-- a thread key, not a tracker.
--
-- RLS is ON with NO policies, which denies everything — the same rule every
-- other mbl_ table follows. Nothing reaches this from a browser: the only door
-- is the functions under /api, and they hold the secret key.
